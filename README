= about ServerSide

ServerSide is an HTTP server framework designed to be as fast as possible, and
as easy as possible to use. ServerSide includes a full-featured HTTP server, a
controller-view system and a bunch of other tools to easily create servers and
clusters of servers.

== Installation

<tt>sudo gem install serverside</tt>

== Source Code

http://serverside.googlecode.com/svn/

== The Daemon

Once you have the ServerSide gem installed, you can use the <tt>serverside</tt>
script to control servers. For example:

<tt>serverside -p 8000 start .</tt>

will start an HTTP server, serving the content of the working directory. You can
stop the server by running <tt>serverside stop .</tt>
 
== Serving Dynamic Content

You can use the ServerSide::Application and ServerSide::Controller classes to
create dynamic web applications. The ServerSide framework also lets you route
requests based on any attribute of incoming requests, such as host name, path,
URL parameters etc.

To start your app, you can either supply the <tt>serverside</tt> script with 
your Ruby code file:

<tt>serverside start ~/myapp/myapp.rb</tt>

Or you can put your code in a file called <tt>serverside.rb</tt> and tell the
<tt>serverside</tt> script the directory path:

<tt>serverside start /home/nc/reality/production</tt>

The script will then load <tt>/home/nc/reality/production/serverside.rb</tt> and
take care of everything else.

== Running a Cluster of Servers

ServerSide makes it easy to control a cluster of servers. Just supply a range of
ports instead of a single port:

<tt>serverside -p 8000..8009 start .</tt>
