== Installation

  sudo gem install serverside

== Usage

Once you have the ServerSide gem installed, you can use the <tt>serverside</tt>
script to control servers. For example:

  serverside start .

will start an HTTP server on port 8000, serving the content of the working 
directory. You can stop the server by running <tt>serverside stop .</tt>

To run the server without forking, use the 'serve' command:

  serverside serve .

=== Running a Cluster of Servers

ServerSide makes it easy to control a cluster of servers. Just supply a range of
ports instead of a single port:

  serverside -p 8000..8009 start .
